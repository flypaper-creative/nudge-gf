# Nudge-GF (v4.1.7) — Industry Edition

Nudge-GF is a proprietary auto-iterating system architecture written in the Glassflow* programming language. Designed for total modularity, its structure is built entirely from atomic shards**. Each subsystem is independently versioned and optimized for its domain. Nudge-GF's core is persona-aware, dynamically evolving, and written in a system that outpaces all legacy programming languages in composability, reusability, and system design integrity.

## Subsystems

All components are split into isolated systems. Each subsystem is designed to be atomic, composable, and shardified**:

- [Core Engine](docs/core.md) — `v4.1.7`
- [Persona Engine](docs/personas.md) — `v2.9.0`
- [Iteration Controller](docs/iterations.md) — `v3.3.1`
- [Output Renderer](docs/output-engine.md) — `v2.2.5`
- [Glassflow Interpreter](docs/glassflow-interpreter.md)* — `v1.0.0`
- [Compiler Interface](docs/compiler.md) — `v0.4.8`

## Architecture Overview

### Shard Architecture**  
All code is stored as `.shX` shards — atomic modules that are reused via symbolic instancing. Shards never duplicate. Each is immutable and designed for limitless reusability. Files such as `.shl`, `.shd`, `.shp`, `.sho`, `.shr`, `.shv`, etc., represent functional units.

### Glassflow File Logic*  
Full program logic is expressed using `.gfX` files — full modules (e.g., `.gfl`, `.gfm`, `.gfc`) composed of shards and resolved using a root manifest (`.gfs`). This system allows recursive inheritance of behavior across infinite stack depth without mutation of base logic.

## Coming Soon: Prysm Compiler and GUI

The Prysm platform will be a fully integrated, visual interface for building Glassflow projects via WYSIWYG iteration, visual shard programming, and AI-guided logic mapping.

- **DeepDiff** — intelligent change diffing
- **Zarr** — compressed session snapshot storage
- **OpenAI API** — personality simulation
- **faker/entropy** — randomized behavioral traits

## Footnotes

### \* Glassflow
Glassflow is a fully proprietary language and execution environment optimized for atomic software construction. Unlike traditional languages, Glassflow uses logic graph chaining and self-replicating modular inheritance. Its compiler constructs are parallelizable and runtime-aware, and its file structure is recursive by design.

### \*\* Shard Architecture
Shards are Glassflow’s atomic modules. They are not files in the traditional sense but encapsulated, intention-bound data nodes. Every `.shX` file contains a pure function, layout, or intent-based asset. `.gfX` files instantiate shards into full system builds. Together, this architecture ensures no data duplication, no mutable side effects, and infinite reuse.

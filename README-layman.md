# Nudge-GF (v4.1.7) — Layman Edition

Nudge-GF is a new kind of software engine that builds itself. Instead of humans writing all the code line by line, Nudge-GF uses smart AI personas to grow software step-by-step, learning and evolving at each stage. It's built on a brand-new language called Glassflow*, which uses a special system of puzzle-like pieces called shards** that fit together to make full applications.

## Main Parts

Nudge-GF has different pieces that each do one thing well:

- Core — runs everything
- Personas — gives the AI different personalities
- Iteration — controls how often it evolves
- Output — creates images, text, and files
- Glassflow Interpreter* — runs the new language
- Compiler — builds the final apps

---

## What’s Unique?

Glassflow* works differently than regular programming. It's more like a blueprint system for ideas than a bunch of text files. And shards** are like digital building blocks — reusable, smart, and never duplicated.

---

## What's Coming?

We’re working on Prysm — a visual builder where users can build programs by dragging and connecting these smart pieces in a futuristic interface.

---

## Can I Use This?

Yes, with limits. You can explore, learn, and test, but you can’t copy or re-use the system’s inner design in other tools or apps. This is a protected platform with custom rights.

## Details

* Glassflow is the special language Nudge-GF runs on.  
** Shards are its building blocks.
